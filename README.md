I like to improve things and make things simpler. Coding for me was always some kind of hobby. I have never treated coding as hard work for money only, even when I was working in a corporation as a Software Engineer.

### Current activity

My current activity is mostly focused at my [Woodworking](https://github.com/dprojects/Woodworking) extension for FreeCAD. However, I am not part of the FreeCAD team, so please don't ask me for FreeCAD support or politics. Coding and woodworking is my hobby and gives me a lot of fun. 

### My accounts

My accounts related to dprojects are only:
* [github.com/dprojects](https://github.com/dprojects) - this here at Github
* [youtube.com/@dprojects.woodworking](https://www.youtube.com/@dprojects.woodworking/videos) - to post new features, tutorials and not overload github with heavy gifs
* [forum.freecadweb](https://forum.freecadweb.org/search.php?author_id=13594&sr=posts) - at FreeCAD forum
* [crowdin.com/profile/dprojects](https://crowdin.com/profile/dprojects) - at Crowdin for translation, but not used
* [github.com/javascriptiscoolpl](https://github.com/javascriptiscoolpl) - my old github account related to JavaScript coding

All other nicknames dprojects at the internet or companies in real-life are not connected with me.
