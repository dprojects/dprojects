# Contact

The best and fastest way to contact me is to open an issue in the repository: <br> 
[github.com/dprojects/Woodworking/issues](https://github.com/dprojects/Woodworking/issues)

# Social media

* [github.com/dprojects](https://github.com/dprojects) - this here at GitHub
* [youtube.com/@dprojects.woodworking](https://www.youtube.com/@dprojects.woodworking/videos) - to add videos about new features
* [crowdin.com/profile/dprojects](https://crowdin.com/profile/dprojects) - at Crowdin for translation, but not used due to text limit
* [github.com/javascriptiscoolpl](https://github.com/javascriptiscoolpl) - my old github account related to JavaScript coding
* [forum.freecadweb.org](https://forum.freecadweb.org/search.php?author_id=13594&sr=posts) - at FreeCAD forum, rare activity. Unfortunately, [I cannot work](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=834597#p834597) with people who [do not respect someone else's work](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=757118#p757118) or treat [valuable people wrong](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=831480#p831480) or [ban them](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=86110) because they [said something wrong in emotions](https://web.archive.org/web/20250617175335/https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/22038). I know from experience that if someone deletes comments it means they have something to hide. So those people are not for me.
